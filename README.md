![alt text](https://github.com/matmadness/HumanShaders/blob/main/splash_screen.png "Splash Screem")

A set of shaders for Godot to create realistic humanoid characters

Godot Version supported: 4.5+ (probably works on 4.4)


This is the full project, including example models and a simple model visualizer. If you only care about the shaders, only download/clone the content from the "HumanShaders" folder.

You can download a demo showcasing the shader capabilities on Itch.io: [Demo Page](https://matmadness.itch.io/godot-human-shaders) 


For now, the shaders available are:

  - Skin shader
  - Eye shader
  - Eye wetness shader



This is a work in progress and not actively maintained, don't expect frequent updates (or updates at all). Instead, use these shaders as base for your project, changing them to better suit your needs.
